        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sports PsychologistðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Mr. Bravo is a continuing Undergraduate for the 
        College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. Expected to graduate 
        in June 2021, he hopes to continue to graduate school and complete a 
        Masters in organizational psychology. He is currently involved in 
        multiple organizations on his university campus and was the former 
        Social Networking Chair of Hermanos Unidos de UC Riverside. Currently, 
        Mr. Bravo is immersed in multiple avenues of the UC Riverside social 
        life; from being the community service chair of the Eta Chapter of Sigma 
        Delta Alpha Fraternity Incorporated, to mentoring over 50 residents as a 
        first-year on-campus resident advisor at Aberdeen-Inverness, to even 
        being in the volunteer corp for the Simon Family Foundation. For fun, Mr.
        Bravo also participates in the campus' Ballet Folklorico team (Ballet 
        Folklorico de UC Riverside) and does poetry in local coffee venues in 
        the Riverside area. Projected for the Winter quarter, Mr. Bravo plans on 
        utilizing his fraternity's chapter into helping out local homeless 
        shelters and animal rescue shelters in Riverside County. Moreover, Mr. 
        Bravo plans to run for a chair position within the UC Riverside Chapter 
        of Psi Chi, the National Honors Society in Psychology. The top three 
        positions they are interested in running for include: President, Vice 
        President, and Fundraiser. Being a double major, Mr. Bravo's majors 
        include Psychology and Theater, Film, and Digital Production (including 
        a concentration in Acting and Directing). Being an acting major, Mr. 
        Bravo mainly works with Ethnic production companies (such as the Latinx 
        Play Project) and is beginning to focus more on film and television 
        acting. In an interview few months previously, he has expressed that his 
        acting role models have included thespians such as Rob Lowe, Denzel 
        Washington, and Will Smith. Being classically trained, Mr. Bravo has 
        also done productions with the PATH program, helping individuals find 
        their voice through theater performance and production. Currently, Mr. 
        Bravo is in their third year Fall quarter of the University of 
        California, Riverside. At 16 registered units, classes that they are 
        taking include: Biology 030 (Human Reproduction and Sexual Behavior), 
        Computer Science 008 (Introduction to Computing), Psychology 152 
        (Abnormal Psychology), and Classical Mythology 040 (Greek Mythology). 
        Due to the UC system's degree requirements, Mr. Bravo has taken courses 
        which have ranged from ethnomusicology, to astronomy, to foreign 
        languages. Touching more upon foreign Languages, Mr. Bravo has been able 
        to fluently speak three languages: English, Spanish, and Mandarin 
        Chinese. Their personal goal is to master five languages prior to 
        becoming 50 years old. They have been able to show excellent leadership 
        and crisis management skills, be a true ethical citizen within their 
        community, and a strong public speaker for underrepresented individuals. 
        They have practiced working in small group projects and large scale 
        tasks, as well as helped others find the leadership within themselves. 
        Mr. Bravo can do and will do the absolute most for whatever you will 
        need their assistance for. He hopes to be able to transfer his skills he 
        has learned thus far into his next workplace. <br><br>
